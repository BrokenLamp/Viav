# Viav
Viav is an open source Discord bot designed to automatically manage your Discord voice channels. When a user joins an empty voice channel, an additional empty channel will be created, so there is always an empty channel for users to join. Additionally, Viav will create a text channel for each voice channel that only the people inside of the channel (as well as administrators) will be able to see.

You can run Viav yourself or add it to your server. Instructions for running it yourself will be added to this readme in the future. You can add it to your server at any time from our [website](https://viav.app/).
